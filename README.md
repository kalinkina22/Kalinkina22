## ‚ú® About Me

I'm a Berlin-based creative with a passion for all things media.  
I love dreaming up fresh concepts, building visual stories, and bringing projects to life ‚Äî from web & 3D design to photo shoots and content creation.  
I also work as a makeup artist, often collaborating on sets and artistic projects.

This is my portfolio, created to support my application for an Ausbildung. It reflects both my technical and artistic sides.
